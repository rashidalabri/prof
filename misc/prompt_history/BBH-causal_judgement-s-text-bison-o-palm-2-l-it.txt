Step 181, training acc: 0.784, instruction: A typical person's judgment of causation is based on a number of factors, including the extent to which each factor contributed to the problem, how responsible it is for the problem, and counterfactuals. They also consider the mental states of those involved, such as their intentions, beliefs, and desires. Ultimately, a typical person will make a judgment about causation that is based on their own personal beliefs and experiences.
