In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. To evaluate the validity of an argument, first identify the premises and the conclusion. Then, determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises. If it does, then the argument is valid. If it does not, then the argument is invalid.
Step 6, training acc: 0.600, instruction: This is a template for evaluating the validity of an argument. First, identify the premises and conclusion of the argument.

Step 38, training acc: 0.680, instruction: This is a template for evaluating the validity of an argument. An argument is valid if the conclusion follows from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. To evaluate the validity of an argument, first identify the premises and the conclusion. Then, determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises. If it does, then the argument is valid. If it does not, then the argument is invalid.
